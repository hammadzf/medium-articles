Associated medium article "From O(n²) to O(log n) — Enlightenment journey through time…complexity" can be accessed [here](https://medium.com/@hammad.zafar/from-o-n²-to-o-log-n-enlightenment-journey-through-time-complexity-4ca7255cce32).

The `Solution` functions in all three files do not contain any guard clauses or error scenarios to cover invalid input. The focus of this article and associated code snippets is on algorithms with different time complexity. 

> All three code files declare the `Solution` and `main` functions with same names in a single directory. This is not best practice and you will get a compiler warning stating that these functions are redeclared in the same block. However, the three files can still be run or executed using `go run` or `go build` commands.
